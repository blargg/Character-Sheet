# Character Sheet
Single page web app for managing a character sheet for [Pathfinder][pfsrd]. A
running version can be found at <https://rpstats.com>

## Status
This project is experimental. This means that the site is not ready for
practical use. Features will be added and removed frequently, and character
information may get cleared out.

## Running
Install [obelisk]. A local version of the server can be run with `ob run`, and
accessed at <localhost:8000>. More information can be found in
the obelisk instructions.

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. For large changes to functionality or code, consider
